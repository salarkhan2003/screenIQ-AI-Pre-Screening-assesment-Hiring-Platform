**RoleScreen AI** is a specialized recruitment infrastructure designed for the trustless hiring landscape of 2026. It replaces traditional resume parsing with **Generative Verification**, cross-referencing candidate claims against JD requirements in real-time.

## 🚀 The Core Infrastructure

### The Intersection Engine
Unlike legacy platforms with static question banks, RoleScreen AI cross-references a candidate's specific resume claims against JD requirements to generate **"Truth Questions."** 
*Example: "You optimized SQL by 40%? Walk through the execution plan you used. Which indexes were redundant?"*

### 10-Bit Assessments
A 10-minute, mobile-optimized "Verification Step" that replaces the traditional first-round recruiter call. High-performers trigger **Adaptive Guardrails**, instantly scaling difficulty to find their upper limit and shortening the test duration.

### Integrity Shield
A proprietary monitoring system using gaze-tracking and browser-lock sensors to detect AI-assisted answering, script-reading, or secondary device usage.
